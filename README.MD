# 🎯 YouTube Ad Skipper

A lightweight Chrome extension that automatically skips or speeds up ads on YouTube.

### ✨ Features

- Skips skippable ads by clicking the "Skip" button
- Speeds up unskippable ads to 16x playback
- Automatically restores normal speed after the ad ends
- 100% client-side, no tracking or data collection

### 📦 How It Works

The extension injects a small script into YouTube pages that:
- Detects if an ad is playing
- Tries to click the "Skip" button if available
- Otherwise, speeds up the video playback
- Restores normal speed after the ad ends
